# Waste-Classification

In this project, I made an images classification of differents waste we can find in trash. I use 15 000 images belongs 30 differents waste with two cat√©gorie. One with classic images of the waste and the second with real life images of the waste. With this diversity, the created model is more diversify and can determine whatever the waste is belong those 30.  
I use the best Keras model and I fine-tune it with my data. With this model, I can have 85% precision on a classification and some error are not really major as some human can also do this kind of mistake.
